write a python script script.py that contains the following blocks. each line is a tool to be matched separately, one after the other:

code to import ROOT and enable multithreading, then import default headers for higgs analysis from this path: /Users/dciangot/opt/miniconda3/tutorials/dataframe/df103_NanoAODHiggsAnalysis_python.h 

code to load branch Events from file root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/root-eos/cms_opendata_2012_nanoaod_skimmed/SMHiggsToZZTo4L.root into an RDataFrame named higgs_df

code to selectplot an Histo1D histogram of ${object} with ${n_bins} bins and range spannin from ${min} to ${max}. Store the image in ${filepath}

code to draw an Histo1D of muons pt with 100 bins, starting from 0 to 200. Then store the image in plot.png

execute script.py
